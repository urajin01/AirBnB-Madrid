# AirBnB-Madrid
This GitHub project serves as a practical exercise in building and evaluating prediction (classification) models using Airbnb dataset. The primary goal is to predict "Superhost" status by leveraging various data-driven techniques and machine learning models.
Data Source: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/
Model Building:
Construct prediction models to determine "Superhost" status.
Make an effort to incorporate a wide range of relevant variables.
Perform the necessary data preprocessing to ensure variables are suitable for model input.
Experiment with different types of machine learning models, considering parameter tuning for optimization.
